# Final Project - Introduction to Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the "Introduction to Deep Learning" course. The project focuses on heart failure prediction using machine learning techniques.

## Repository Contents

1. **data.csv** - The original Heart Failure Prediction dataset.
2. **main_Final.ipynb** - The Jupyter Notebook containing the final code implementation for the project submission.
3. **final_report.pdf** - The final report documenting the project methodology, results, and conclusions as per course requirements.
4. **unbalanced_cp_data.csv** - A dataset containing all the data before any balancing was applied.
5. **moderate_balanced_cp_data.csv** - A partially balanced dataset.
6. **full_balanced_cp_data.csv** - A fully balanced dataset.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Final-Project---Intro-to-DL.git
   ```
2. Open `main_Final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
4. Run the notebook.
5. Refer to `final_report.pdf` for detailed insights into the project.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is the **Heart Failure Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle. It includes multiple patient attributes that help predict the likelihood of heart failure. Data preprocessing and balancing techniques were applied to improve model performance.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that accurately predicts heart failure based on patient data. Various preprocessing techniques, data balancing methods, and model architectures were explored.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras
